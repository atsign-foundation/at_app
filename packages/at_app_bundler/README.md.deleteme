## Overview

at_app_bundler is a bundler that generates dart models for [at_app_create](https://pub.dev/packages/at_app_create).

## Get started

To get started, install the tool using pub:

```sh
dart pub global activate at_app_bundler
```

*Additionally, pub may prompt you to add the global bin to your PATH variable, please do so before proceeding.

## How it works

at_app_bundler bundles a modified version of a [mason brick](https://pub.dev/packages/mason_cli#creating-new-bricks) into the necessary dart models for at_app_create. You can build this custom brick by including an additional `template.yaml` file in your brick.

### Usage

See the [Example tab](https://pub.dev/packages/at_app_bundler/example) on pub.dev.
