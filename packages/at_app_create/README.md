## Overview

at_app_create is a package that facilitates the generation of flutter applications from templates using the [mason package](https://pub.dev/packages/mason). You can use this package in combination with [at_app_bundler](https://pub.dev/packages/at_app_bundler) to build your own version of `flutter create` using custom templates.
